Description: Converts R objects into network edgelist and nodelist format for
    visualization and analysis with packages like 'igraph', 'tidygraph', and
    'ggraph'. Works with atomic vectors (sequential edges), data frames
    (column-pair edges with tidyselect), and tree-based model objects
    ('randomForest', 'tree'). Also provides one-step graph construction
    via as_igraph() and as_tbl_graph() methods for tree models.
