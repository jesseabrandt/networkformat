Description: Provides S3 methods to convert decision tree models from popular
    machine learning packages ('randomForest', 'tree', 'xgboost') into network
    edgelist format for visualization and analysis. The package extracts
    parent-child relationships from tree structures, enabling network-based
    exploration and analysis using tools like 'igraph' and 'tidygraph'.
    Supports extraction of both edge lists (parent-child relationships) and
    node lists (with attributes) from trained models.
