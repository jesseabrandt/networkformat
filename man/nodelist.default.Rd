\title{Extract Node List from a Vector or Unsupported Object}
\usage{
\method{nodelist}{default}(input_object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_object}{An atomic vector, or an object for which no specific
  nodelist method exists.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{name} (unique values in order of
  first appearance) and \code{n} (frequency count).  For unsupported types,
  an error is raised.
}
\description{
When called on an atomic vector (character, numeric, integer, logical,
factor), returns the unique values as a node list with a \code{name}
column (preserving order of first appearance) and an \code{n} column
giving the frequency of each value.  For all other unsupported types,
an informative error is raised.
}
\examples{
# Character vector
nodelist(c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B"))

# Numeric vector
nodelist(c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1))

# Unsupported type
try(nodelist(list(a = 1, b = 2)))
}
