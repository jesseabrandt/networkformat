\title{Extract Edgelist from a Vector or Unsupported Object}
\usage{
\method{edgelist}{default}(input_object, weights = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_object}{An atomic vector, or an object for which no specific
  edgelist method exists.}

\item{weights}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, duplicate edges are collapsed and a
  \code{weight} column is added with the count of each unique
  \code{(from, to)} pair.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{from} and \code{to} (and
  \code{weight} when \code{weights = TRUE}).  For unsupported types, an
  error is raised.
}
\description{
When called on an atomic vector (character, numeric, integer, logical,
factor), creates a sequential edgelist connecting each element to the next:
element \code{i} is connected to element \code{i + 1}.  For all other
unsupported types, an informative error is raised.
}
\examples{
# Character vector
edgelist(c("A", "B", "C", "D"))

# Numeric vector
edgelist(1:5)

# With duplicate counting
edgelist(c("A", "B", "A", "B", "C"), weights = TRUE)

# Unsupported type
try(edgelist(list(a = 1, b = 2)))
}
