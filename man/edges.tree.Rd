\title{Extract Edgelist from Tree Model}
\usage{
\method{edges}{tree}(input_object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_object}{A tree model object from the tree package}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{from}{Parent node index}
    \item{to}{Child node index}
    \item{label}{Split condition label (variable and threshold)}
  }
}
\description{
Converts a tree model object (from the tree package) into a network edgelist
representation. Uses a parent-stack algorithm to traverse the binary tree
structure and construct parent-child relationships. Each edge is labeled
with the split condition.
}
\examples{
if (requireNamespace("tree", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # Fit a classification tree
  tree_model <- tree::tree(Species ~ ., data = iris)

  # Extract edgelist
  tree_edges <- edges(tree_model)
  head(tree_edges)

  # View edge labels (split conditions)
  tree_edges$label

  # Visualize with base R (if desired)
  # plot(tree_model)
  # text(tree_model)
}
