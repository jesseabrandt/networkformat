# Why networkformat?

Decision trees, random forests, and other tree-based models are networks ---
nodes connected by edges --- but they don't come in network format. The
output of `randomForest::getTree()` is a matrix of daughter indices and split
points. The `tree` package stores its structure in a frame with implicit
parent-child relationships. To visualize or analyze these models as graphs,
you have to write bespoke reshaping code every time.

**networkformat** does that reshaping for you. It extracts standard
**edgelists** (source-target pairs) and **nodelists** (node attributes) from
models and tabular data, putting everything in the format that the rest of
the R network ecosystem expects.

# The R network ecosystem

Once your data is in edgelist/nodelist form, a large ecosystem of packages
is available:

**igraph** --- the workhorse graph library for R. Handles graph construction,
shortest paths, centrality, community detection, clustering, and much more.
Also converts to **adjacency matrices** (`as_adjacency_matrix()`) and
**incidence matrices** (`as_incidence_matrix()`) for linear algebra
approaches.

**tidygraph** --- a tidy interface built on top of igraph. Lets you
manipulate graphs with dplyr verbs (`mutate`, `filter`, `arrange`) while
keeping the underlying igraph structure. If you're comfortable with the
tidyverse, this is the natural way to work with graphs.

**ggraph** --- a ggplot2 extension for graph visualization, designed to work
with tidygraph/igraph objects. Supports tree layouts, force-directed layouts,
circular layouts, and more.

**network** / **statnet** --- an alternative graph ecosystem focused on
statistical network modeling (ERGMs, latent space models). igraph objects can
be converted to network objects via `intergraph::asNetwork()`.

networkformat gets your data into this ecosystem. From there, you can
visualize, compute statistics, fit models, or convert to matrices ---
whatever your analysis requires.
